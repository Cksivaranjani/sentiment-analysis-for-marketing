## Introduction

Sentiment analysis is a crucial task in understanding the opinions and emotions expressed in marketing content. This project applies several machine learning models to perform sentiment analysis on marketing data and compares their accuracy to determine the most effective model.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Sentiment analysis using multiple machine learning models
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Visual representation of model performance

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis-marketing.git
   cd sentiment-analysis-marketing
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare your data**: Place your marketing data in the `data/` directory.
2. **Run the preprocessing script**:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```
3. **Train and evaluate models**:
   ```bash
   python train_models.py
   ```
4. **Compare model performance**:
   ```bash
   python compare_models.py
   ```

## Models Comparison

In summary, the table shows the comparative accuracy of different machine learning models on sentiment analysis for marketing, with the Random Forest Model having the highest accuracy, followed by the Support Vector Machine (SVM) Model and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Model.

| Model                        | Accuracy |
|------------------------------|----------|
| Random Forest                | 0.90     |
| Support Vector Machine (SVM) | 0.87     |
| Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)| 0.85     |
